 <h1 style="font-family:Young Serif;">Greek Mythology</h1>
<p> Greek mythology, Oral and literary traditions of the ancient Greeks concerning their gods and heroes and the nature and history of the cosmos. The Greek myths and legends are known today primarily from Greek literature, including such classic works as Homer&apos;s Iliad and Odyssey, Hesiod&apos;s Works and Days and Theogony, Ovid's Metamorphoses, and the dramas of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. The myths deal with the creation of the gods and the world, the struggle among the gods for supremacy and the 
triumph of Zeus, the love affairs and quarrels of the gods, and the effects of their adventures and powers on the mortal world, including their link with natural phenomena such as thunderstorms or the seasons and their connection with cultic sites or rituals. Among the great stories of Greek mythology and legend are those of the Trojan War, the voyage of Odysseus, Jason&apos;s search for the Golden Fleece, the exploits of Heracles, the adventures of Theseus, and the tragedy of Oedipus.
